This repository contains a simulator modelling the
behaviour of the computation network system as well
as some algorithms for load balancing in the network.

Simulator time is discrete with equal time quants (time units) 
generated by tick() function, base network model is contained 
in simulator.h and consists of
-- Processing nodes: these objects represents nodes
	network and can process tasks. Each node has a local storage
	in its disposal. Main characteristic of the processing node
	is its performance -- number of elementary computation 
	actions the node performs each time unit.
-- Comunication channels: any communication channel links
	two processing nodes with each other. One of these nodes
	can send data to another. Main characteristic of the channel
	is its capacity -- the number of bits that can be sent
	via the channel per time unit.
-- Tasks: each task is initially assigned to some node and
	is stored in corresponding local storage of this node.
	Each node has two charachteristics. "Context size" -- 
	the number of bits to be transferred if the task is to be
	sent to the neighbouring node; "complexity" -- the number
	elementary operations needed to precess the task.
-- Schedulers: each node has his own scheduler that is
	responsible for local scheduling of the tasks (if the task
	is to be sent away from the node, scheduler decides
	which communication channel should be used to sent the
	task away). Thus, schedulers take care of local scheduling 
	rules.


General problem of load balancing is to decide for each task
whether it should be processed by the current node or to be sent 
to some of the nodes neighbour.
